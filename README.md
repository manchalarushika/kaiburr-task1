#  Task Executor Management API (Kaiburr Assessment - Task 1)

##  Project Overview
This project implements a **secure and robust RESTful API** using **Spring Boot** and **MongoDB**.  
The core functionality is to manage a list of shell commands (Tasks) and securely execute them on the host operating system.  
This submission fulfills the requirements of **Task 1** of the **Kaiburr Technical Assessment**.

---

##  Features Implemented

###  Task Management (CRUD)
- Create (via `PUT`), Read (single/all/search), and Delete tasks.

###  Secure Command Execution
- Executes the stored shell command using a separate, isolated process (`ProcessBuilder`).

###  Security Validation
- Implements strict pre-execution validation to prevent **Command Injection vulnerabilities** by blocking dangerous characters and system-critical commands (`rm`, `sudo`, `bash`, etc.).

###  Execution Logging
- Records the start time, end time, exit code, and captured standard output/error (`stdout`/`stderr`) for every command execution, storing them directly within the Task record.

###  Persistence
- All Task data, including execution history, is persisted using **MongoDB**.
